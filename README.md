## What is Yutnori?
It is a game played by young and old alike and is usually most often played during national South Korean holidays. The game consists of tossing 4 sticks shaped like half moons. The players toss the 4 sticks in the air and each combination of sticks landing represent the number of points the players receive. The points are then used to move the players' life pieces around the circular or rectangular board and the player that circles the board 3 times first, wins the game.
This rendition of the gameboard differs from the original and much loved gameboard. Normally, the gameboard is shaped like a rectangle with an 'X' that extends from the four corners across the middle. In the original game, the players are also able to decide on the route they wish to take their pieces. The different routes help players avoid being run into by their opponents
